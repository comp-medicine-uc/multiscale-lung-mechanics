# Tests files

( Files that implement a numerical simulation or test. These files are typically Jupyter notebooks (`.ipynb`). Include an overall descripction here. Use subfolders if neccesary. ***Source files / libraries DO NOT go here!*** )


## Files

(List all files, including a brief description - see template below.)

- `test01-consistency.ipynb`: Numerical test of tangent operator consistency.
- `test02-square.ipynb`: Numerical simulation of tissue mechanics on a square domain with prescribed displacements on the boundary.
- `test03-lung.ipynb`: Numerical simulation of tissue mechanics on a anatomical lung domain with prescribed tractions on the boundary.
