abstract = {The aim of this article is to identify and interpret the data provided by modern ventilators that provide the greatest clinical help in evaluating respiratory mechanics during mechanical ventilation. In intensive care, respiratory mechanics can be assessed in dynamic conditions (no flowinterruption) or static conditions (occlusion techniques) to record compliance and resistance and to monitor pressure, flow, and volume. Real-time visualization of the pressure curve is crucial for monitoring during volume-controlled ventilation, in which pressure is the dependent variable. Analysis of the pressure curve has little clinical utility during pressure-controlled ventilation, in which the dependent variable is the flow waveform, which varies according to changes in the mechanics of the respiratory system. Pressure-volume loops and flow-volume loops provide useful information on the dynamic trends of the respiratory system compliance and resistance, respectively. Modern ventilators provide complete monitoring of respiratory system mechanics, which is our guideline for optimizing ventilatory support and avoiding complications associated with mechanical ventilation. {\textcopyright} 2005 Daedalus Enterprises.},

abstract = {The alveolar septum consists of a skeleton of fine collagen and elastin fibers, which are interlaced with a capillary network. Its mechanical characteristics play an important role in the overall performance of the lung. An alveolar sac model was developed for numerical analysis of the internal stress distribution and septal displacements within the alveoli of both normal and emphysematic saline-filled lungs. A scanning electron micrograph of the parenchyma was digitized to yield a geometric replica of a typical two-dimensional alveolar sac. The stress-strain relationship of the alveolar tissue was adopted from experimental data. The model was solved by using commercial finite-element software for quasi-static loading of alveolar pressure. Investigation of the state of stresses and displacements in a healthy lung simulation yielded values that compared well with experimentally reported data. Alteration of the mechanical characteristics of the alveolar septa to simulate elastin destruction in the emphysematic model induced significant stress concentrations (e.g., at a lung volume of 60{\%} total capacity, tensions at certain parts in an emphysematic lung were up to 6 times higher than those in a normal lung). The combination of highly elevated stress sites together with the cyclic loading of breathing may explain the observed progressive damage to elastin fibers in emphysematic patients.

@article{BurgstallerEtal2017,
abstract = {The pulmonary extracellular matrix (ECM) determines the tissue architecture of the lung, and provides mechanical stability and elastic recoil, which are essential for physiological lung function. Biochemical and biomechanical signals initiated by the ECM direct cellular function and differentiation, and thus play a decisive role in lung development, tissue remodelling processes and maintenance of adult homeostasis. Recent proteomic studies have demonstrated that at least 150 different ECM proteins, glycosaminoglycans and modifying enzymes are expressed in the lung, and these assemble into intricate composite biomaterials. These highly insoluble assemblies of interacting ECM proteins and their glycan modifications can act as a solid phase-binding interface for hundreds of secreted proteins, which creates an information-rich signalling template for cell function and differentiation. Dynamic changes within the ECM that occur upon injury or with ageing are associated with several chronic lung diseases. In this review, we summarise the available data about the structure and function of the pulmonary ECM, and highlight changes that occur in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), asthma and lung cancer. We discuss potential mechanisms of ECM remodelling and modification, which we believe are relevant for future diagnosis and treatment of chronic lung disease.

@article{JahaniEtal2014,
abstract = {We evaluate the non-linear characteristics of the human lung via image registration-derived local variables based on volumetric multi-detector-row computed tomographic (MDCT) lung image data of six normal human subjects acquired at three inflation levels: 20{\%} of vital capacity (VC), 60{\%} VC and 80{\%} VC. Local variables include Jacobian (ratio of volume change) and maximum shear strain for assessment of lung deformation, and air volume change for assessment of air distribution. First, the variables linearly interpolated between 20{\%} and 80{\%} VC images to reflect deformation from 20{\%} to 60{\%} VC are compared with those of direct registration of 20{\%} and 60{\%} VC images. The result shows that the linearly-interpolated variables agree only qualitatively with those of registration (P{\textless}0.05). Then, a quadratic (or linear) interpolation is introduced to link local variables to global air volumes of three images (or 20{\%} and 80{\%} VC images). A sinusoidal breathing waveform is assumed for assessing the time rate of change of these variables. The results show significant differences between two-image and three-image results (P{\textless}0.05). The three-image results for the whole lung indicate that the peak of the maximum shear rate occurs at about 37{\%} of the maximum volume difference between 20{\%} and 80{\%} VC, while the peaks for the Jacobian and flow rate occur at 50{\%}. This is in agreement with accepted physiology whereby lung tissues deform more at lower lung volumes due to lower elasticity and greater compliance. Furthermore, the three-image results show that the upper and middle lobes, even in the recumbent, supine posture, reach full expansion earlier than the lower lobes. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

@article{MeadTakishimaLeith1970,
abstract = {Although lungs are exposed to transpul- monary pressure, the air spaces within are distended solely by forces applied from surrounding tissues. By relating these forces to the areas on which they operate, we derive the effective pressure distending air spaces. In uniformly expanded lungs this pressure probably approximates transpulmonary pressure. In nonuniformly expanded lungs the effective distending pressure differs from trans- pulmonary pressure, and in the appropriate sign to reduce the nonuniformity. This interdependence of air-space distention bears on a number of aspects of pulmonary function, including the size of air spaces which may be expanded from the gas-free state, the static and dynamic stability of air spaces, the dryness of air spaces, the forces distending airways and blood vessels within lungs, and the distribution of pulmonary edema. The principal function of the mechanical interdependence would appear to be to support uni- form expansion of air spaces. The principal functional risk that it entails is increase in capillary transmural pressure in regions which become subjected to abnormally high outward-acting stress.},

abstract = {In an effort to understand how the lung is deformed by its own weight, we have analyzed the distribution of regional expansion, stresses, and surface pressures in a theoretical elastic lung-shaped model using the technique of finite elements. In the upright position, the parenchyma was most expanded at the apex and least at the base. Stresses in both the vertical and lateral directions were maximal at the apex. As the lung was inflated from very low volumes to total lung capacity, parenchymal expansion and stress at the apex first decreased, then increased. This behavior can be explained by the increasing rigidity of the expanded lung which enabled it to resist distortion by its own weight. At functional residual capacity, the stress at the apex was near its minimum. The differences in intrapleural pressure down the lung were volume dependent, increasing at very low volumes. In the inverted lung, the regional differences in stress, strain, and surface pressures were less marked because of the shape of the chest.},

@article{ChoiEtal2013,
abstract = {The purpose of this work was to explore the use of image registration-derived variables associated with computed tomographic (CT) imaging of the lung acquired at multiple volumes. As an evaluation of the utility of such an imaging approach, we explored two groups at the extremes of population ranging from normal subjects to severe asthmatics. A mass-preserving image registration technique was employed to match CT images at total lung capacity (TLC) and functional residual capacity (FRC) for assessment of regional air volume change and lung deformation between the two states. Fourteen normal subjects and thirty severe asthmatics were analyzed via image registration-derived metrics together with their pulmonary function test (PFT) and CT-based air-trapping. Relative to the normal group, the severely asthmatic group demonstrated reduced air volume change (consistent with air trapping) and more isotropic deformation in the basal lung regions while demonstrating increased air volume change associated with increased anisotropic deformation in the apical lung regions. These differences were found despite the fact that both PFT-derived TLC and FRC in the two groups were nearly 100{\%} of predicted values. Data suggest that reduced basal-lung air volume change in severe asthmatics was compensated by increased apical-lung air volume change and that relative increase in apical-lung air volume change in severe asthmatics was accompanied by enhanced anisotropic deformation. These data suggest that CT-based deformation, assessed via inspiration vs. expiration scans, provides a tool for distinguishing differences in lung mechanics when applied to the extreme ends of a population range.},

@article{RauschEtal2011b,
abstract = {Mechanical ventilation is not only a life saving treatment but can also cause negative side effects. One of the main complications is inflammation caused by overstretching of the alveolar tissue. Previously, studies investigated either global strains or looked into which states lead to inflammatory reactions in cell cultures. However, the connection between the global deformation, of a tissue strip or the whole organ, and the strains reaching the single cells lining the alveolar walls is unknown and respective studies are still missing. The main reason for this is most likely the complex, sponge-like alveolar geometry, whose three-dimensional details have been unknown until recently. Utilizing synchrotron-based X-ray tomographic microscopy, we were able to generate real and detailed three-dimensional alveolar geometries on which we have performed finite-element simulations. This allowed us to determine, for the first time, a three-dimensional strain state within the alveolar wall. Briefly, precision-cut lung slices, prepared from isolated rat lungs, were scanned and segmented to provide a three-dimensional geometry. This was then discretized using newly developed tetrahedral elements. The main conclusions of this study are that the local strain in the alveolar wall can reach a multiple of the value of the global strain, for our simulations up to four times as high and that thin structures obviously cause hotspots that are especially at risk of overstretching.},
