%Numerical simulations of lung clinical applications using a large strain poroelastic model: pressure-controlled ventilation (PCV), volume-controlled ventilation (VCV) and supersyringe method

## Abstract

The mechanical behavior of the lungs has long been associated with the structural properties of alveoli in pulmonary medicine. However, this structure-function relationship has mostly been qualitative, as experimentation in real lungs is costly and limited by ethical standards. Here we present a poromechanical multiscale model that connects key alveolar features with organ-level function. To this end, we first revisit an asymptotic homogenization framework for finite-deformation poromechanics and formulate fine-scale and coarse-scale problems that govern lung mechanics. We further inform the coarse-scale problem using a tetrakaidecahedron micromechanical model for the alveolar response at the fine scale that strongly depends on the alveolar-wall elastic modulus and the initial alveolar porosity. Based on this formulation, we construct a non-linear finite element model from anatomical geometries to simulate the response of human lungs connected to a mechanical ventilator under pressure-controlled and volume-controlled protocols. We show that the predicted signals for airway pressure, airway flow, and lung volume capture the dynamic waveform characteristics observed in human lungs. Further, we demonstrate that lung behavior, measured in terms of respiratory-system compliance, strongly depends on the alveolar-wall elasticity and alveolar porosity. In particular, we show that variations in these microstructural parameters result in marked changes in compliance that follow the structure-function relations observed in lungs with pulmonary fibrosis and emphysema, two prevalent chronic respiratory diseases. We envision that our multiscale lung model can enhance current {\it in silico} efforts to experimentation in respiratory research and provide a computational framework for clinically-relevant simulations.  


## Results

The main results of this research are shown below. Figure 3 shows the airway pressure, flow and volume signals predicted by the poroelastic model of the
lung during PCV simulations.

The respiratory system compliance and resistance for the five constitutive models studied
obtained from fitting the equation of motion to the PCV finite-element simulations are reported in Table 2.

The predictions of lung respiratory signals generated by our finite-element model using the CM3
constitutive law were compared with those predicted by a single-compartment lung model, see Figure 4.

The temporal evolution of the jacobian and alveolar pressure fields during PCV respiratory cycle for all the constitutive models considered is reported in Figure 5. We studied three key time instants to make comparisons between the models analyzed: time of peak flow  ( $t_1$ in Figure 3), time of peak volume/end of
inspiration ( $t_2$ in Figure 3), and time when half of the expiration subcycle has passed ( $t_3$ in Figure 3).

To study the evolution of stress fields in our lung simulations, we considered the effective hydrostatic and von Mises stress tensor invariants. Figure 6(a) reports the the temporal evolution of the (effective) hydrostatic stress fields. Figure 6(b) shows the evolution of the (effective) von Mises stress.

The performance of our finite element model was also evaluated by predicting signals in the VCV mode.

Figure 8 shows the results from simulations of the supersyringe method. The time evolution of the airway

Finally, we also compute the lung compliance for each constitutive model, see Table 3.
